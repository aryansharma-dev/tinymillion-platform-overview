# Problem & Solution

## The Problem
Creators and small sellers face major challenges:
- No personal branding or identity on big marketplaces
- High commissions and platform dependency
- Building Shopify-like stores is expensive and technical
- No single platform offers store + dashboard + creator identity together

Result: Creators cannot grow independently.

## The Solution – TinyMillion
TinyMillion solves this by providing:
- A personal mini-store for every creator
- Full branding (name, photo, bio, store identity)
- Dedicated Mini-Admin dashboard
- Secure multi-tenant backend
- AI tools for growth, content, pricing, and support

TinyMillion becomes a **growth partner**, not just a marketplace.
